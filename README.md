#### Differences between the deployed version and the development version:
Due a bugg in Gitpod.io i was not able to use environment variable for the secret key,
this is changed now on heruko and the old secret key used durring the development is changed as well.

I selected a simple and clean layout from bootstrap theme,
I removed all unecessary boxes to make it easy for the eye to focus only on the books.
